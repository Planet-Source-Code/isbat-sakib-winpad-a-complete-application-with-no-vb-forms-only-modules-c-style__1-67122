## WinPad \- A Complete Application with no VB Forms, only modules \(C\-style\)


</div>

### Description

First of all, I should say I dropped the development of this application maybe one or two years ago. I am submitting it because there are some useful things here which might be helpful to some. I started to develop this application when I used Win98. If you remember, Win98 Notepad had some important features missing such as keyboard shortcuts and it annoyed me much. So I intended to develop an exact replica of Win98 Notepad having keyboard shortcuts and also to see how far VB can go. Then I switched to WinXP, that was also a long time ago and so I dropped its development 'cause WinXP Notepad is far better. Nonetheless, it is almost complete except that it only cannot print and command-line interface is not supported. Runs well as far as I know. Just don't use end button in VB IDE while you are running it in VB IDE. I haven't commented the code completely, only the searching module is commented completely. I must express my thanks to those who first uploaded their submissions here and showed me the way how to develop apps in VB using original C-style. Anyway, there might be something here that could come to your help. Thanks for downloading.
